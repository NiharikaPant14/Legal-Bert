# üèõÔ∏è Legal BERT: Fine-Tuning BERT for Legal Text Analysis 

This repository showcases my project where I fine-tuned the **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** model for **legal text analysis**. The objective was to leverage NLP techniques to process and understand complex legal documents effectively.

### ‚ú® Features:
- **Preprocessing Legal Text**: Cleaned and preprocessed raw legal data for better model performance.  
- **Fine-Tuning BERT**: Adapted a pretrained BERT model specifically for legal-domain language understanding.  
- **Text Classification**: Implemented classification tasks like identifying legal clauses, categorizing contracts, or labeling case summaries.  
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Recognized legal-specific entities such as case names, statutes, and legal terms.  
- **Semantic Similarity**: Analyzed similarities between legal cases or documents.  

### üöÄ Technologies Used:
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face library for model fine-tuning.  
- **PyTorch**: Backend for training the model.  
- **NLTK / SpaCy**: For text preprocessing and tokenization.  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualizing model performance.  
- **Google Colab**: Used for model training and experimentation, leveraging cloud-based resources.

### üìÇ What‚Äôs Included:
- **`Legal_BERT.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the full workflow, from data preprocessing to model fine-tuning and evaluation.
- **Dataset**: The legal dataset used for training the model is the [Swiss Judgment Prediction dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rcds/swiss_judgment_prediction).


All the **requirements** and **dependencies** are outlined within the **`Legal_BERT.ipynb`** file.

### üìÇ How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Open the **`Legal_BERT.ipynb`** file in **Google Colab** or any Jupyter environment.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially. All necessary requirements are already included within the notebook.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Applications:
- Legal document categorization and retrieval.  
- Automating clause identification in contracts.  
- Assisting legal professionals with insights from large corpora of legal texts.
